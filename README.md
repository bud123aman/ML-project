# Facial Recognition Using a Siamese Network
### Overview
This project implements a facial verification system using a Siamese Neural Network (SNN), a deep learning architecture designed to measure the similarity between two images. The model is trained to distinguish between facial images by learning a meaningful feature representation using contrastive loss. The project is developed using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy, and includes real-time facial recognition capabilities.

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Preparation
The dataset is structured into three categories:

    -> Anchor: Reference images of individuals.

    -> Positive: Different images of the same person.

    -> Negative: Images of different people.

-> Uses the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset for training.

-> Real-time face data can be captured using a webcam.
### 2. Preprocessing Pipeline
-> Face Detection: Extracts facial regions from images using OpenCV.

-> Data Augmentation: Applies transformations to improve model robustness.

-> Pair Generation: Creates anchor-positive and anchor-negative pairs for training.

### 3. Siamese Network Architecture
-> The model consists of two identical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that extract feature embeddings from input images.

-> The extracted embeddings are compared using a distance metric (L1 distance layer).

-> The final output is a similarity score that determines whether the two images belong to the same person.

Network Components:

    -> Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features from images.

    -> MaxPooling Layers: Downsample feature maps.

    -> Flatten & Dense Layers: Convert extracted features into a vector representation.

    -> Contrastive Loss Function: Optimizes the distance metric between positive and negative pairs.
### 4. Model Training
-> The model is trained using contrastive loss, which minimizes the distance between similar images and maximizes the distance between dissimilar images.

-> Uses Adam optimizer for efficient learning.

-> The training dataset consists of both genuine pairs (same person) and imposter pairs (different persons).
### 5. Facial Verification System
-> Real-time Face Capture: Captures images using a webcam.

-> Face Embedding Comparison: Compares new face embeddings with stored anchor embeddings.

-> Identity Verification: Accepts or rejects a match based on a similarity threshold.

Applications
-> Biometric Authentication: Secure login and access control.

-> Attendance Systems: Automated identity verification in workplaces and institutions.

-> Surveillance & Security: Identifying authorized personnel.

-> Personalized User Experiences: Customized AI-driven applications.
